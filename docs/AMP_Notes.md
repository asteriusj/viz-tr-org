AMP pages are built with 3 core components:
AMP HTML
AMP HTML is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance.

AMP JS
The AMP JS library ensures the fast rendering of AMP HTML pages.

AMP Cache
The Google AMP Cache can be used to serve cached AMP HTML pages.

## AMP HTML ⚡

[AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.  AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.

You can learn more at [ampproject.org](https://www.ampproject.org/) including [what AMP is](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/about-amp/), [how it works](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/how-amp-works/) and the importance of [validation in AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate).  You can also walk through [creating an AMP page](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create) and read through the [reference docs](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components).

[TODO - look at and experiment with amphtml as standard pattern for web component building !!!!
